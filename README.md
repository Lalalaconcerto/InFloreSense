# InfloreSense


This project is to visualise and sonify moisture and temperature plant data using a leaf as the user interface​: A leaf is used as a touch sensor to trigger the data to be revealed to a user. The plant’s needs were expressed visually with an 8x8 pixel matrix and auditorily with a choral voice and bass drum. We sonified the full temperature and moisture range that could be expected, allowing our users to develop an intuition for the plant’s exact conditions from listening to the audio.
